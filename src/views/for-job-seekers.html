            <h3 class="section__title text--blue">TBB is working to establish safe and legal pathways for refugees to be linked to the global labor market. This is a unique opportunity to take part in an initiative that is different from traditional solutions.</h3>
            <p>TBB is forging a new legal pathway for people who are displaced from their home countries due to conflict or persecution. Only a small number will be placed in employment during this initial pilot phase. By registering in the Talent Catalog, forcefully displaced individuals can show employers the wide range of talent across different sectors that they can consider in international hiring. Then, TBB will expand this initiative.</p>
            <p>In order to register with us, please ensure that you meet the following requirements:</p>
            <ul class="list list--numbers">
                <li>You have been displaced from your home country due to war, conflict, or persecution and are living in Jordan or Lebanon. *In the future, TBB plans to expand to other countries.</li>
                <li>You face legal barriers to accessing employment in your field.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Refugee registration with UNHCR is not mandatory to register with TBB. TBB’s program is open to individuals of any nationality who meet the above criteria.</p>
            <p>Please Note: We understand that every person’s case is unique. If you are unsure if you are eligible for our program and wish to inquire, please contact us at <a href="mailto:info@talentbeyondboundaries.org">info@talentbeyondboundaries.org</a>.</p>

            <p class="text--big">Currently, individuals can register with TBB on our online platform, the Talent Catalog, which is a secure website that collects information about employment experience, education, skills, and language capabilities.</p>

            <p>Registration takes about 10 minutes and is free of charge. Registrants can download their personalized CV after successful completion of a profile.</p>

            <h5 class="text--center">To register, visit: <a href="www.tbbtalent.org">www.tbbtalent.org</a></h5>

            <p>TBB uses this online <a href="Talent Catalog" class="text--underline">Talent Catalog</a> to show employers the skills and talents of those who are displaced from their home countries so that employers around the world can consider hiring them during their international recruiting. TBB has already used the Talent Catalog to secure several employer partners who have initiated the recruiting process with a small number of candidates registered in the Talent Catalog.</p>

        <h4 class="text--spaced text--blue">Talent Beyond Boundaries is a nonprofit organization; it is not a traditional job placement or resettlement agency.</h4>
        <p>The role of Talent Beyond Boundaries is to identify employers and work with candidates to overcome the unique barriers faced by individuals who have fled from conflict that can hinder their access to international employment.</p>
        <p>TBB cannot guarantee employment and will not select individual candidates to be hired. Rather, TBB will connect qualified applicants with companies seeking their skill sets. The corporate partners will decide whether to make a job offer and the potential candidate will decide whether to accept an offer of employment. Our services to job seekers include:</p>
