                Our mission is to open international employment pathways
                for skilled refugees to fill talent gaps.</h2>
            <p>War and conflict have forced millions of skilled people to find
                refuge in places where they are unable to work legally.
                Talent Beyond Boundaries is working to connect this often
                excluded talent pool with employers around the world who are
                searching for skilled workers.
            </p>
            <p>
                The pathways that Talent Beyond Boundaries is establishing allow
                refugees to find stability and employers to gain new talent,
                while reducing the number of dependents on aid.</p>
