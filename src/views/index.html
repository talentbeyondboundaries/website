            <p>War and conflict have forced many millions of skilled people to find refuge in places where they are unable to work legally. Talent Beyond Boundaries is working to connect this often excluded talent pool with employers around the world who are searching for talented workers.</p>
            <p>The complementary pathway for refugees that Talent Beyond Boundaries is establishing allows refugees to find stability, employers to gain new talent, and provides the global economy more active participants, while also reducing the number of dependents on aid.</p>
