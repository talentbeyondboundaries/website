            <p>Currently, international law and conventions recognize three potential solutions for the world’s 22.5 million refugees: return, second country integration, and third country resettlement. This approach has not changed substantially since World War II.</p>

            <h3 class="section__title text--blue">We are the only group developing international skilled work opportunities with and for refugees, enabling them to move on skilled labor visas.</h3>
            <p>Data from UNHCR - in combination with TBB’s own, more-detailed Talent Catalog - shows that there are vast numbers of talented refugees currently prohibited from working. Meanwhile, companies in countries around the globe are experiencing critical skill shortages that hinder their competitiveness and development.</p>
            <p>By linking skilled refugees with countries and companies that need their skills, TBB is forging a new sustainable solution for refugees to rebuild their lives while boosting the global economy. Expanding labor mobility for refugees has the potential to improve the lives of tens of thousands of refugees and their families, and fundamentally alter future responses to refugee crises.</p>
            <p>In collaboration with governments and partners around the world, TBB is identifying and overcoming the barriers that have kept refugees from rebuilding their lives and careers through international employment.</p>
