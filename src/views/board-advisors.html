                <p>​Erika Kelton has substantial experience and success representing US and international whistleblowers in cases brought under US whistleblower reward programs. She has won three SEC whistleblower awards for clients, including the largest SEC whistleblower award — more than $32 million awarded to an international whistleblower in a case involving massive securities fraud. She also secured for a separate client an SEC whistleblower award of more than $3 million. The SEC whistleblower awards to her clients total more than one-third of the whistleblower reward amounts the SEC has made. As an expert in whistleblower enforcement approaches, Ms. Kelton has consulted with the U.S. Congress, the Securities Exchange Commission, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and the Internal Revenue Service on the establishment and workings of the agencies’ whistleblower programs. Both the SEC and the IRS have featured her as an invited speaker at internal conferences for their attorneys and investigators to discuss more effective ways to work with whistleblowers in enforcement matters.</p>

From 2009-2013, he served as Chairman of the White House Fellows Commission. Before he retired from the firm in 2013 to accept President Obama’s appointment as the US ambassador to Italy, the Wall Street Journal and the National Law Journal called him “the nation’s premier whistleblower attorney.” The National Law Journal included Mr. Phillips in its “100 most influential lawyers in America” lists, comprised of attorneys who “have the power to shape public affairs, launch industries, shake things up and get things done.” Mr. Phillips worked closely with Congress to revise and strengthen the False Claims Act based on his research that showed the Civil War law held great potential for fighting fraud against the government. After the law was enacted in 1986, he devoted his professional career to representing whistleblowers in qui tam lawsuits until his appointment as ambassador. Mr. Phillips has a long history of involvement in public interest law. He earned his law degree from Berkeley Law (formerly Boalt Hall) at the University of California School of Law, where he was an editor of the California Law Review. He then joined the Los Angeles law firm of O’Melveny & Meyers as an associate.</p>
